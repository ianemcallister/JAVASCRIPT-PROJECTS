#### Pizza Menu
this project is a menu sed to order pizza with a variety of selected toppings. It then takes the input information and calcualtes a price for the order.

#### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first and then users are off playing the classic game.  Users can decide which token each player wants to sue and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.

#### Calculator
A basic 4 function calcuator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
